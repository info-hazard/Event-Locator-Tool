# Event-Locator-Tool

## User Story
A quarter into our Coding Bootcamp course, our knowledge is put to the test in creating our own application. As our first group project, We wanted to create an app that generated event happening within your city. The Applicaiton itself will access your current address and filter the events within cit range. As someone who doesn't have anything to do on a saturday night, I want to be able to see local events based on my address so I can find events that are near me with ease.

## Acceptance Criteria
The following is the criteria that must be met: 

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
Finally, You must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.


## Assets
Th main functionality of our application is to display events. To achieve this, we utilised the [Ticketmaster API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/). One of the Challenges that we faced was working with an API key (access key). We used Javascript and Jquery hand in hand to work around that obsticle. In order to grap the users location, we used [IP Geolocation API](https://ip-api.com/) and incorperate it with the ticketmaster API to filter the event search by city. The styling of the app was done with [Foundations Framework](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/).
